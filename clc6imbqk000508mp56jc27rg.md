# Postman API 101 Event

I recently had the opportunity to attend the Postman API 101 Event, and I must say, it was a fantastic learning experience.

The event was held online and consisted of a series of talks and workshops led by [Sai Raksha Kala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-raksha8121/) and [**Sunku Sarthak**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunkusaarthak/) in the field of API development and management. The speakers covered a wide range of topics, including What is API and how it works, Setting up Postman for API development and testing, Making API requests and working with responses, Debugging and troubleshooting API issues.

One of the highlights of the event for me was the workshop on API testing and debugging. The speaker walked us through the process of testing and debugging APIs using Postman, a popular tool for API development and testing. We learned how to set up test cases and run them automatically, and how to use the Postman console to debug API requests and responses.

Here are some of the Methods that I have learned in the event:

* GET
    
    The GET method is used to retrieve information from the server and is generally used to read data from a server. It does not modify the data on the server and is considered safe, as it does not have any side effects.
    
* POST
    
    The POST method is used to send data to the server, typically to create a new resource. It is often used to submit HTML form data to a server.
    
* PUT
    
    The PUT method is used to update an existing resource on the server. It is similar to the POST method, but it replaces the existing resource rather than creating a new one.
    
* DELETE
    
    The DELETE method is used to delete a resource from the server. It is considered a destructive action, as it permanently removes the resource from the server.
    

Overall, the Postman API 101 Event was a great opportunity to learn from the Postman Student experts and enhance my knowledge and skills in API development and management. I would highly recommend this event to anyone looking to get started with APIs or to deepen their understanding of this rapidly-growing field.
